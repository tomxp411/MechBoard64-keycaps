### src-keys-main-vice-positional.svg

Keycaps for the "Positional" layout in VICE. This uses the default VICE positional map, with @, *, and = 
on their own keys. Other punctuation symbols are moved around, as well. This gives the most accurate keyboard
map, since keys are as close as possible to the Commodore VIC-20/64 mappings. 

* src-keys-main-vice-symbolic.svg

This relocates symbols that are in a different place on US PC keyboards. The RESTORE key is also moved to the \ key,
which is more comfortable on ANSI keyboards. Because this messes with the PETSCII symbols present on the @ and * keys, 
those keys are duplicated on the cursor island. 

* src-keys-main-vice-compact.svg

If you are using a 75% compact keyboard (the ones with the arrow keys snugged up under the SHIFT key), you may wish
to move +, Home, @, ^, Â£, and * over to the numeric keypad. Use this layout for those changes. 

### src-keys-main.svg

### gtk3_sym.vkm

This is a modified Symbolic layout for VICE. This is meant to be used with the latest Windows version. 
use this with the src-keys-main-vice-symbolic.svg image file.
